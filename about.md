I am Valerii. I studied Clinical Psychology in Moscow as my first degree, and currently I am pursuing my masterâ€™s degree in Cognitive Neuroscience at HU Berlin. For my thesis in Moscow, I applied natural language processing and data analysis in the field of psychotherapy research. At the same time, I worked as a research assistant to Tommaso Fedele in the Institute for Cognitive Neuroscience at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow. We analyzed MEG recordings of epileptic patients using machine learning algorithms to reveal seizure initialization and propagation. In Berlin, I decided to switch my research to social and cognitive psychology. Since April 2020, I have been working in the Social Intelligence group at HU Berlin, where I have been developing behavioral experiments online and in virtual reality.
