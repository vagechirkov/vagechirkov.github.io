Hi, Iâ€™m Valerii! ðŸ‘‹

I studied Clinical Psychology as my first degree, and currently I am pursuing my masterâ€™s degree in Cognitive Neuroscience at the Humboldt University of Berlin. ðŸ¥°ðŸ§ ðŸŽ“

For my thesis, I applied natural language processing and data analysis in the field of psychotherapy research. ðŸ›‹ðŸ’¬ðŸ“Š At the same time, I worked with [Tommaso Fedele](https://github.com/tommytommy81) on epilepsy diagnostics. We analyzed MEG recordings of epileptic patients using machine learning to reveal seizure initialization and propagation. In Berlin, I decided to switch my research to social and cognitive psychology. Since April 2020, Iâ€™ve been working in the [Social Intelligence Lab](https://social-intelligence-group.github.io/), where Iâ€™ve been developing behavioral experiments online and in virtual reality. ðŸ•¹ðŸ–¥ðŸ”®

Iâ€™m interested in developing open-source software for cognitive psychology and neuroscience. You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ValeriiChirkov).
